This is a user defined process flow management code. You can write our functions and then with the help of the creator and executor arrange it 
sequentially. It also helps to pull out intermediate step results.

Currently not optimized for large datasets or parallel computation (work in progress)
only input from one step can be added to next step, working to add multiple steps input to next step.
